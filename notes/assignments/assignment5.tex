    \section{Guidelines for runtime scoping}

    \begin{ex}
       Explain the individual cases of the output by referring to semantics of runtime scoping. 

       \paragraph{1.} For the first statement, \texttt{stmtscope1}, we print out the result of the statement by calling \texttt{lookup} on the environment returned by the function \texttt{exec env stmtscope1}. This uses runtime scoping because the execution, and thus the creation of the environment occurs when we need the result of the execution, in this case to print it.
